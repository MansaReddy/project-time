# Basic Information

This is a project for the Udacity front end nanodegree. It is a neighborhood map of the Hyderabad City and some points of interest in that area.

## Following API's are used
     1.  Google maps API.
     2.  Wikipedia API is used as a third party API.
     3.  Google Streetview service is used to get the streetview of the Location
         if it is available.

## Basic Instruction

1. Open the index.html file in a modern browser (chrome, firefox, ie11, etc.).
2. Click markers or list items to select a location and retrieve info about it.
3. Type into the filter/search box to filter the shown locations.
4. Ensure options above filter/search box are what you want them to be.

## Notes

* Most points have a panorama or streetview nearby.  Those will open one in the infowindow if so.
* This tool uses Knockout.
* The page is responsive but it is not intended for mobile viewing on small devices.  If you are viewing on a mobile phone, landscape is recommended as the width of the list is fixed.
* Google maps api v3 powers the maps and panoramas.
